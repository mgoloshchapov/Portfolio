## Cold Atoms

Here is some modelling that I've made in my laboratory:

- [Two-photon Rydberg excitation with spontaneous decay]
  
- [Laser phase noise and Qubit]

- [Atom temperature: Release & Recapture](/Portfolio/projects/Rel&Rec/Rel&Rec)


## Ising model: random-bond, pinning, CNN.

Ising models with different types of interactions are studied using single-spin flip Monte-Carlo: 

- [Domain wall pinning & Magnetic memory](/Portfolio/projects/PinningMemory/PinningMemory)

- [Random-bond Ising phase diagram](/Portfolio/projects/RandomIsing/RandomIsing)

- [CNN classification of temperature](/Portfolio/projects/CNN_Ising/CNN_Ising)

- [Ferro- and antiferromagnetic]

- [Next-nearest neighbour & Dipolar interactions]
