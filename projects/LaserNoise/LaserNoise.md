### Laser phase noise and Qubit decoherence.

Frequency stablization of laser to a reference cavity leads to the emergence of servo-bumps, which is a laser phase noise localized at some frequencies. 
Also, there is a white noise in spectral density of the laser phase noise.

Laser phase noise trajectories are sampled as a sum of cosines with random phases uniformly distributed on $[0, 2\pi]$ 
and amplitudes defined by laser phase noise spectral density.

Influence of white noise and servo-bump on single-qubit rotations is investigated according to [1].
